# 🧩 CLI Maze Game

A simple command-line maze game where you navigate through directories and files using **basic shell commands** like `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, and `cd ..`.  
Your goal: **explore the maze, find hidden hints, collect passwords, and unlock the final room**.

---

## 🎮 Game Concept

- The maze is represented as a set of directories (folders).
- Each directory can contain:
  - Empty paths
  - Text files with **clues or passwords**
  - Locked rooms that require the correct password to enter
- Players must use their **knowledge of CLI commands** to progress.



1. Start the game by running:

📜 Rules
Only the above commands are allowed (pwd, ls, cd, cd .., cat).
Passwords are case-sensitive.
Do not skip rooms; clues are hidden in files.
Your progress depends on solving the maze step by step.
Objective: Reach the final room and escape the maze.


Only use these moves to win:
ls → “show me what’s here”
pwd → “where am I?”
cd room-name → “go into this room”
cd .. → “go back”
ls -a → “show me even the hidden rooms/files”

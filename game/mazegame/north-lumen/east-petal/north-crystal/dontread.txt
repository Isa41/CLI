╔═══════════════ ✦  ODE TO HIDDEN DOORS  ✦ ═══════════════╗
║ Night walks softly through folders upon folders.          ║
║ A single dot before a name is a seal of silence:  .       ║
║ A hush in the wires whispers: “ls seeks—but add a charm,  ║
║ and shuttered doors will show themselves.”                 ║
║ You breathe the charm aloud:  `ls -a`                     ║
║                                                           ║
║ In the old courtyard of Windows, a rusted echo answers;   ║
║ you return the call with the gatekeeper’s sign:  `dir /a` ║
║                                                           ║
║ Then azure light brushes stone in PowerShell’s gallery;   ║
║ a firm hand parts the shadowed names:  `Get-ChildItem -Force` ║
║ Or, if your spell must be brief:  `dir -Force`            ║
║                                                           ║
║ And so the dot reveals its passages, one by one.          ║
║ The path thins the dark; your steps become the key.       ║
║ Now you know: the secret lives in the dot,                 ║
║ and in the word spoken rightly.                            ║

How to see hidden files and folders:

Linux / macOS (terminal / bash / zsh):
  # List all files (including hidden ones):
  ls -a
  # Example: first go into a folder, then list files
  cd game/north-lumen/east-petal
  ls -a

Windows CMD:
  # Show all files including hidden/system files:
  dir /a

PowerShell:
  # Show hidden files:
  Get-ChildItem -Force
  # or shorter:
  dir -Force

Notes:
- On Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS), hidden files or folders usually start with a dot (.). For example: .hidden-gate-owl
- Use `ls -a` instead of just `ls` to reveal them.
